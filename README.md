# hello-world
My first repository, learning how to use GitHub
Hi world,

I am a dallas cowboys fan, obviously from my avatar. I enjoy long walks on the beach, yeah right! I do enjoy sports and computers. I have decided to learn how to code. I am starting out with HTML and CSS. Then I will progress from there.
